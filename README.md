## Why?
In our daily life we do a lot of tasks, some we do intentionally, I mean without remembering todo, some we forget to do. This app for those who forgets or we wants to make organize tasks.

- In here we can make our things done without fail ‚úÖ
- We can store info which is need to be remembered üß†
- We can label the tasks üö©
- We can categorize the tasks üëç
- We can prioritize 'em and stay focussed on what to-do first ü•á

## About

This is completely backend application to manage todos. Implemented using Python, Django. 
Managing tasks/works in our daily life is very hard, we can minimize those things using **TODO App**.

## How to Use...? ü§î

Using a _backend application_ without a proper UI is very hard considering normal user.
I am actually developing _frontend application_ for this **TODO app**. 

If somebody interested to develop their own UI of this application. Yes go ahead, consume these backend code.
